A simple weather tracker that remembers your search history and shows a 5 day forecast

## Description

PRIMARY GOAL: Allow you to track the weather for multiple cities

WHAT HAPPENS: 

 - When you search for a city, the current weather and a 5 day forecast appears
 - Any cities you search are added to a list that you can then select and change the selection to

## Usage

This is useful if you are trying to keep track of the weather for multiple cities and you just want the basic info.

This could be very useful for road trip planning or if you have family members that live far away from you, you could also use this to see how the weather is for them.

This uses a google maps API to get the location so you could also get very specific on the location to get a weather report for your home.
